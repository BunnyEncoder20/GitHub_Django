# GitHub_Django

- This is for the learnings from Hitesh Sir playlist [Chai aur Django]('https://youtu.be/j6szNSzw4BU?si=O5Ks22vKB0RvTpGS')
- Django is a complete Framework for building web applications using Python.
- It is one of the fastest web development frameworks and is much loved by cooperates as it can run on lesser hardware resources. 
- This is cause it is a older framework and gives more control over the project.
